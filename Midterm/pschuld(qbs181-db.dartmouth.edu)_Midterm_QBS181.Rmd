# $\text{\underline{1) Data issues}}$ 
## **part a) Data issues**

### Issue 1: Some participants have no data recorded besides in the variables that have data for all participants ("Taking insulin now", "Respondent sequence number", "Doctor told you have diabetes")
```{r}
sort(colSums(is.na(raw_data) > 0), decreasing = TRUE)
```

### Issue 2: Question DIQ175A-X ask a single question: why a participant thinks they are at risk for diabetes. Each variable in DIQ175A-X hold all possible answers from the particpants, but if they did not respond with one of those answers, that variable receives an NA for that particpant. 

### Issue 3: Question DID060 ask for how long the participant took insulin, but the values can possibly be in months or years, which is specified in DID060U. In order to simplify analysis, DID060 should be in the same units.

### Issue 4: Both DID260 and DID350 contain units columns (DIQ260 and DIQ350) corresponding to units of time that can vary by response. In order to simplify analysis, DID260 and DID350 should be in the same units.

### Issue 5: Some variables have a mix of categorical values ("refused", "don't know") and continuous values (as "range of values"), while others are purely categorical. The categorical variables are coded by numbers, which is not as user-friendly as it could be. I would argue that any variable taking on a range of continuous values should be left as numeric, as factoring thse could complicate downstream analysis.

### Issue 6: The dataset, even aftert subsetting is sparsely populated with real data and many NA's still exist.

## **part b) Addressing issues**
### Issue 1: Drop all rows/particpants who have NA for all variables not listed in Issue 1 above.

### Issue 2: Recode DIQ175A-X to be '1' if the respondent gave that explanation for that particular variable and '0' otherwise. As a result, particpants giving a particular response can be easily tallied during analysis.

### Issue 3: Convert all specified time periods (from 1 to 55 in DIQ060) to years by dividing all units in months (DIQ060U) by 12. Drop the units variable (DID060U), since all units are now the same. Change the label of DID060 to include "years" for interpretability.

### Issue 4: Convert all specified time periods to "per days" by dividing all units by the proper conversion factor. Drop the units variable (DID260U and DID350U), since all units are now the same. Change the labels of DID260 and DID350 to include "per day" for interpretability.

### Issue 5: Convert categorical variables not containing a "range of values" code to factors and place labels for interpretability.

### Issue 6: Consider imputation, but must get more information about the analysis plan.

\newpage

## **Part c) Justification**

### Issue 1: Participants only having the three variables ("Taking insulin now", "Respondent sequence number", "Doctor told you have diabetes") won't be useful in a further analysis, since these variables don't have much informative value on their own.

### Issue 2: DIQ175A-X are variables that correspond to one question. If the respondent did not give a response relating to a given variable in this list, the result should be "False" or "0" rather than NA, which is misleading and suggests the data are missing.

### Issue 3: This change to DID060 allows all values to be in the same units to simplify downstream analysis. DID060U is no longer needed since all measurements are in years.

### Issue 4: This change to DID260 and DID350 allows all values to be of the same units to simplify downstream analysis. DID260U and DID350U are no longer needed since all measurements are in years.

### Issue 5: This change does not affect the data in any way. It only makes the dataset simpler to interpret and it could keep these variables from having to be coerced as factors in a downstream analysis.

### Issue 6: Addressing missing data could be done a number of ways from mean/median imputation to dropping the column altogether. However, I would argue that any manipulation of the data requires context- what is the downstream analysis going to be? For example, I would not want to imput A1C levels if this is going to be the response variable in a prediction model. It would be more justifiable to impute if A1C level was a covariate. Since the analysis plan was not provided in the assignment, imputation is not appropriate.

### Issue 1:
```{r}
raw_data_subset <- raw_data %>%
  select(!SEQN, !DIQ010, !DIQ050)
```

##### find sequences numbers of participants with NA in all other variables

```{r}
na_seqns <- raw_data_subset[rowSums(is.na(raw_data_subset)) > 50,]$SEQN
```

##### filter raw data to subset with data in other variables

```{r}
raw_data_subset <- raw_data[!raw_data$SEQN %in% na_seqns,]
sort(colSums(is.na(raw_data_subset) > 0), decreasing = TRUE)
print(nrow(raw_data_subset))
